# Robust Object Detection (VisDrone-DET)

This project compares object detection models (YOLO, Faster R-CNN, Deformable DETR) on VisDrone-DET.
We evaluate performance under clean conditions and under synthetic degradations (noise/blur/low-res).
Focus: robustness, recall under worst-case conditions, and defense-oriented surveillance scenarios.
